While at the root level of the project, type 'npm run seed' to seed the database, then type 'node server.js' to open the server on your local machine. Open Insomnia to interact with the database.

  ## Usage

  Since this application mimics the back end of a website, Insomnia will need to be used to interact with the database. Different types of RESTful API calls can be made through Insomnia.
